# 🏆 Horizon Universal Architecture & Excellence Blueprint

This document defines the "Golden Rules" and architectural standards for all projects within the Horizon platform. It is intended for both human developers and AI agents to ensure consistency, scalability, and high code quality across the entire ecosystem.

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Pillars

### 1. The "Single Source of Truth" API
- **Tooling**: Use **NSwag** or **OpenAPI** to auto-generate TypeScript clients.
- **Models & Structure**: The auto-generated client should include all **Response Models** and **Request Structures**. Never manually define these in the frontend.
- **Rule**: Whenever the backend DTOs change, re-run the client generator.
- **Benefit**: Zero "type mismatch" bugs.

### 2. Standardized Error Handling
- **Backend**: Use a global `ExceptionMiddleware`. No `try-catch` blocks in controllers unless for very specific logic.
- **Responses**: Always return `ProblemDetails` (RFC 7807).
- **Frontend**: Use a central notification system (e.g., `react-hot-toast`) to display these errors.

### 3. Container-First & Infrastructure-as-Code
- **Docker**: Every core dependency (API, Web, DB, Cache) must be in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Environment**: Use `.env` files for secrets. Use `render.yaml` or similar for cloud infrastructure definition.
- **Rules**: Local dev must be "Plug & Play" with a single helper script (`dev.ps1`) that handles dynamic port allocation and service startup.

### 4. Background Job & Multi-Channel Delivery
- **Offloading**: Never perform slow operations (Email, external API sync, heavy processing) in the request-response cycle. Use **BullMQ** (for Node.js/NestJS) or **Hangfire** (for .NET).
- **Reliability**: Jobs should be retriable and traceable.
- **Fallback**: Implement multi-channel defaults (e.g., WebSocket for real-time, Email for fallback).

### 5. Resilient Session Management
- **UX Requirement**: Users should never be kicked out due to expired short-lived tokens.
- **Pattern**: Implement a 401 Interceptor that triggers an automatic renewal (refresh token) and retries the original request seamlessly.

### 6. Universal State & Caching
- **Standard**: Always use a robust data-fetching library (e.g., `@tanstack/react-query`) for caching and state synchronization.
- **Benefit**: Ensures a "snappy" UI with built-in optimistic updates and automated background refetching.
- **Parity**: All frontends (Web, Mobile) MUST adopt the same caching logic.

### 7. Real-time Communication & Presence
- **Technology**: Use **Socket.IO** (NestJS) or **SignalR** (.NET) for bidirectional, real-time communication.
- **Pattern**: Implement room-based/hub-based communication for scoped updates.
- **Mobile Integration**: Use singleton instances for persistent connections across screens.
- **Fallback**: Always ensure REST APIs are available as fallback for critical operations.

### 8. Observability & Health Monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: All logs must be structured (JSON format with contextual properties). Use **Seq** for visual log search.
- **Health Checks**: Implement `/health` endpoints for orchestration and monitoring.
- **Transient Fault Handling**: Implement retries and circuit breakers for infrastructure dependencies (DB, Cache, Storage).
- **Persistence Strategy**: All infrastructure data (DB, Cache, Logs) must persist across restarts via Docker volumes.

### 9. Pluggable Storage Abstraction
- **Abstraction**: Applications must interact with storage via an interface (e.g., `IStorageService`) rather than direct filesystem calls.
- **Hybrid Support**: The architecture should support multiple providers (Local Disk, S3, Cloudinary) switchable via configuration.
- **Path Resolution**: Use a centralized resolver to handle transitions between relative local paths and absolute production URLs.

### 10. Implementation Excellence & Patterns
- **Standardized Onboarding**: Complex flows must be broken into discrete, verifiable steps (e.g., Identity Verification -> Resource Allocation).
- **Tooling Automation**: Repetitive developer tasks (setup, verification, seeding) MUST be scripted (e.g., `dev.ps1`).
- **Dynamic Infrastructure**: The `dev.ps1` script handles environmental conflicts by automatically re-mapping ports for Redis, DB, and Seq if defaults are taken.

## 🚀 DevOps Workflow Patterns

### Northern Workflow (Build & Test)
- **Goal**: Code quality, formatting, and logical correctness.
- **Tools**: VS Code, PowerShell, GitHub Actions, **Prettier**, **ESLint**.
- **Rule**: Never merge if formatting checks, linting, or tests fail.

### Southern Workflow (Docker & Deploy)
- **Goal**: Environment parity and deployment reliability.
- **Rules**: A feature is only "Done" when it passes health checks in the container mesh. All infrastructure MUST be ephemeral-ready.

---

## 🌿 Git & Collaboration

### Git Tagging & Semantic Versioning
- **Versioning Standard**: Follow **Semantic Versioning** (SemVer): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- **Automated Management**: Use automation tools (e.g., **Google's Release Please**) to manage versions and changelogs.
- **Rule**: Never manually edit `CHANGELOG.md` files managed by automation.

### Commit & PR Strategy
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent a single logical change.
- **Micro-Commit Strategy**: Commits should be kept short and broken into smaller commits by features. Related or interdependent changes should be committed and pushed together.
- **Conventional Commits**: Use the `type(scope): description` format (feat, fix, chore, etc.).
- **Squash Merge**: Default for feature branches to keep history clean.

## 🛡️ Security & Performance Standards

### Security Headers
Every project must implement:
- **CSP (Content-Security-Policy)**
- **X-Frame-Options: DENY**
- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**
- **Referrer-Policy: no-referrer**
- **Rate Limiting** (IP-based)

---

## 📜 Naming Conventions & Style
- **Namespaces**: Use file-scoped namespaces (C#) and consistent directory structures (TS).
- **Interfaces**: Start with `I` (C#).
- **Async**: Methods must end in `Async` (C#).
- **Components**: PascalCase for UI components.

---

## 📖 Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
Projects should document project-specific ADRs separately. Global platform choices include:
- **DB**: Prefer production-grade relational databases (Postgres) for parity.
- **Observability**: Structured Logging (Seq) + Centralized Log Dashboard.
- **Caching**: Distributed caching (Redis) for horizontally scalable services.

---

## ✅ Gold Standard Verification
1. **Zero-Error Frontend**: No `any` types, Vite/Build success.
2. **Standardized Formatting**: Ruleset-compliant project-wide.
3. **Stable Infrastructure**: Health checks green for all mesh services.
4. **Horizon Guardian Compliance**: The codebase is audit-ready for the **Horizon Guardian** engine.

---

## 🤖 Future Agent Instructions
1. **Read the Blueprint**: Always check this file first.
2. **Modularize First**: If a file exceeds 200 lines, extract logic.
3. **Audit the Chain**: Ensure changes propagate from Entity -> DTO -> Handler -> API -> Client.
